**Python Coffee Machine Project**

This project simulates the operation of a coffee machine using Python. It has been developed with the goal of practicing and demonstrating programming skills, especially in the use of dictionaries, functions, and loops. The simulation allows for interaction with the user as a real coffee machine would, managing the inventory of ingredients and the payment process.

**Features**:

-**Coffee Machine Simulation**: The program simulates the selection of drinks, the consumption of ingredients, and the payment process.

-**Ingredient Management**: Utilizes dictionaries to manage the inventory of basic ingredients. Ingredients are consumed with each coffee made.

-**Ingredient Refill**: Implements a keyword for adding more ingredients when they run out, ensuring continuous availability.

-**Payment Process**: Accepts four different types of coins. It calculates the total and checks if the amount paid is sufficient, giving change if necessary or indicating if more money is needed.

-**Friendly Interface**: Includes two logos to make the project more entertaining and visually appealing.

**Technologies Used**:

-**Programming Language**: Python

-**Development Environment**: PyCharm

-**Data Structures**: Dictionaries, for inventory management; functions, to organize the logic of the program; conditionals for exercise logic; and loops, for necessary iterations.

**How to Use**:

-**Program Start**: Upon executing the script, the user is shown the available coffee options.

-**Coffee Selection**: The user chooses the desired coffee.

-**Payment**: The user is asked to insert coins. The program indicates if the amount is sufficient and processes the transaction.

-**Coffee Preparation**: Ingredients are deducted from the inventory, and the coffee delivery is simulated.

-**Ingredient Refill**: If more ingredients are needed, a specific keyword can be used to restock the inventory.

**Requirements**:

To run this project, you will need:

-Python installed on your computer.

-A code editor or IDE that supports Python, such as PyCharm.

**Installation**:

No additional modules or packages are required to run this project, as it uses Python's standard libraries.

**Contributions**:

Contributions are welcome. If you have ideas to improve the project or add new functionalities, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
